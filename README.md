The Devscast Community Platform is for those who want to impact the community by creating content around their passions, sharing knowledge, but also learning.

The goal of the platform will be to promote the profiles of all developers in the community, but also to centralize French learning resources and work opportunities, etc...

Users can publish content in order to help others, but also to learn and increase their visibility

### Requirements

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) : A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies, so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.

### Code style
This project uses [lint](), code style standard and static analysis.

If you find that one of your pull reviews does not pass the CI server check due to a code style conflict, you can easily fix it by running:

```bash
make lint 
make test
```
